# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in Python
- Taken from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python)
- We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)

## Purpose of the Kata
The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice of designing tests and refactoring. 
The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small steps, 
running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

You will see that without any Tests in place, you will be lost while refactoring.

## Tasks
- From the start position (main branch), create a new branch
- Fix the existing Test and add some new ones
- Refactor the "production" code (gilded_rose.py) to improve its design (readability, maintainability)
