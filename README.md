# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in Python

- Taken from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python)
- We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)

## What is the Gilded Rose?

The [Gilded Rose](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gilded_Rose) is an [Inn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Inn) in the
Game [World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft).
It is basically a shop where one can buy items, food, and drinks.

## Purpose of the Kata

The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice of designing tests and refactoring.
The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small steps,
running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

You will see that without any Tests in place, you will be lost while refactoring.

## What is Tidying?

Tidying :broom: is a development activity where we change the structure (not the behaviour!) of existing code to improve
its readability.

## What is Refactoring?

Refactoring :hammer: is a development and testing activity to improve the design (readability, maintainability, reducing
complexity) of existing code by **changing its internal behaviour** while preserving its functionality.
By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with it.

## Gilded Rose Requirements Specification

The specification of the Gilded Rose shop
is [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md).

## Tasks

1. From the start position (main branch), create a new branch
2. Study the (vague) requirements and think about how you could cover them in the current code with tests.
3. Fix the existing Test and add some new ones which reflect the current (external) behavior (spec) of the production
   code
4. Tidy (structure) the code in order to improve readability
5. Refactor (change the behaviour) of the production code to improve its design
6. Tidy (structure) more as needed
7. Add a test for the new feature "Conjured items"
8. Implement the new feature "Conjured items" (which degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items)
9. Reflect on the exercise and document your learnings

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do not re-write the production code from scratch
- Write Unit Tests

## Tips

- As you go on with refactoring, ask yourself the following: am I changing the structure of the code (then this activity
  is called _tidying_) or changing the behaviour of the code?
- Take small steps and run your Tests after each change.

## Python hints

### pytest

Install/Upgrade the following things as dependencies in the projects .venv (virtual environment):

- `pip install -U pytest` (see [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/getting-started.html#install-pytest))
- `pip install -U pytest-watch` (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-watch/))

## Learnings

### Refactoring

- First and foremost: refactoring existing code should not lead to changes and bugs in existing functionalities.
- When we change the structure of existing code, we call that activity _tidying_.
- Before we do some behaviour changes to the existing code, we might want to tidy things first to get a
  clearer overview.

### Other

- Commits are like checkpoints to come back to in case we mess something up and the tests are failing.
- Lift up conditional refactoring: extract a method with all the code with the duplicated conditional

### Code Smells

- Repeated conditional checking `Aged Brie` and `Backstage passes`. So these parts are linked with each other.

### Unit Tests

- It would take a lot of time and tests to get a descent business logic coverage.
