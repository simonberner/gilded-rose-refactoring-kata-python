# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in Python
- Taken from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python)
- We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)

## The context: What is the Gilded Rose?
The [Gilded Rose](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gilded_Rose) is an [Inn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Inn) in the Game [World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft).
It is basically a shop where one can buy food and drinks.

## Purpose of the Kata
The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice of designing tests and refactoring. 
The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small steps, 
running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

You will see that without any Tests in place, you will be lost while refactoring.

## Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
The specification of the Gilded Rose shop is [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md).

## Tasks
- From the start position (main branch), create a new branch
- Fix the existing Test and add some new ones which reflect the current behavior (spec) of the production code
- Refactor the "production" code (gilded_rose.py) to improve its design (readability, maintainability)
- Update the "system" with the new feature: "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
- Reflect/document your learnings in this README

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do not re-write the production code from scratch
- Write Unit Tests

## Tips
- While refactoring try to take small steps, don't rush ahead and run your Tests after each change
